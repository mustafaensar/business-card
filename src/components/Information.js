      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a graduate of Ankara University Faculty of Law.
        I decided to take Web Developer training and 
        I got a Web Programming certificate in Switzerland. 
        I am currently taking Blockchain Developer trainings 
        from USTechacademy. My future goals are to produce 
        projects in Web3 and to work in the legal field of Web3.
        I currently have knowledge about HTML, CSS, Javascript, 
        Node and React.

      <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>
      Music is my relaxation area. Both listening to songs of 
      different genres and playing songs that I have chosen 
      from them are the top of my hobbies. I have a traditional 
      instrument called Baglama belonging to Turkish culture.
      Along with the old traditional songs, I am also including 
      new generation pop songs in my list.
      Apart from that, hiking and watching old top movies by 
      famous actors are also among my hobbies.
